# Design Doc

### why did you choose to organize your data in this particular way?
- I choose to organize my folder structures this way because its easier to navigate 

### talk a bit about the "harder" routes that you worked on
- The most challenging routes I worked on was the /sell route. I wouldn't it was hard but it did take huge chunk of time compared to other routes because of many different logic we needed to consider and make it work together somehow. The way I approached this route was by first reading the problem description until I fully understood it, breaking it down into multiple subparts, coding it and testing until the code was functional. I did run into many errors but because I had broken down this problem into multiple subparts, it made it fairly easy to point out the error and debug. 

### how did you decide on certain response codes?
- Due to limited time, I didn't spend much time on returning back the correct response codes, however, if I had more time, I would definitely research more and return appropriate response codes for a smoother error handling experience
